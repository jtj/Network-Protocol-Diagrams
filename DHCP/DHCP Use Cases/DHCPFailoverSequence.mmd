  %% The switch forwards the broadcast to both servers

    and DHCP2 does not respond

    %% --- Time passes and DHCP Server 1 goes down ---
    Note over Client,DHCP1: Client waits 30 minutes, DHCP Server 1 goes offline

    %% --- Lease Renewal Process (Failover) ---

    Client->> DHCP1: DHCPREQUEST (Unicast) (no response)

    %% After no response, the client broadcasts a new request
    Client->>Switch: DHCPREQUEST (Broadcast)
    activate Switch

    %% The switch forwards the broadcast to the remaining active server
    Switch->>DHCP2: Forwards DHCPREQUEST
    deactivate Switch

    %% DHCP Server 2 acknowledges the request
    DHCP2->>Switch: DHCPACK (IP: 192.168.1.100)
    deactivate DHCP2
    activate Switch

    %% The switch forwards the acknowledgement to the client
    Switch->>Client: Forwards DHCPACK
